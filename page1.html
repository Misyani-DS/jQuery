               <p>The HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt; tag is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript).</p>
               <p>However, the &lt;canvas&gt; element has no drawing abilities of its own (it is only a container for graphics) - you must use a script to actually draw the graphics.</p>
               <p>The getContext() method returns an object that provides methods and properties for drawing on the canvas.</p>
               <p>This reference will cover the properties and methods of the getContext("2d") object, which can be used to draw text, lines, boxes, circles, and more - on the canvas.</p>

               <p>Today we are introducing a new logo and identity family that reflects this reality and shows you when the Google magic is working for you, even on the tiniest screens.
               As you will see, we have taken the Google logo and branding, which were originally built for a single desktop browser page,
               and updated them for a world of seamless computing across an endless number of devices and different kinds of inputs (such as tap, type and talk).</p>
